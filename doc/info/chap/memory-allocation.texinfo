@cpindex Memory allocation
@cpindex Allocate memory
The ability to allocate memory of on at compile-time
unknown amount is an important feature for most
programs.

@cpindex Virtual address space
@cpindex Virtual memory-address
@cpindex Memory, virtual address space
@cpindex @sc{RAM}
@cpindex Swap space
On modern operating systems, processes do not have
direct access to the memory. Only the operating system
kernel does. Instead, the process have virtual
memory-addresses, that the kernel maps to either,
real @sc{RAM}, swap space (disc backed), file segments,
or zeroes.

@cpindex Forks
@cpindex Exec:s
@cpindex Process image
@cpindex Memory sharing, private memory
@cpindex Private memory sharing
@cpindex Memory deduplication
@cpindex Deduplication memory
Memory for a process is either allocated programmatically,
or when the process forks (is created) or exec:s
(changes process image.) The operating system kernel is
typically configured to share a much memory between processes
as possible. For example, and a process forks, they will
share their memory rather than duplicate the memory, and
the kernel will only remap the memory when the processs'
memory content diverges. It is also possible to allocate
memory in such a way that processes can share it. so that
updates from one process influences the other processes.

@cpindex Virtual address space segments
@cpindex Memory segments
@cpindex Segments, virtual address space
A process' virtual address space is divided into segments.
There are three important segments.

@table @i
@item text segment
@cpindex Segment, text
@cpindex Text segment
@cpindex @code{.text}
@cpindex Instructions
@cpindex Static constants
@cpindex Constants, static
@cpindex Literals
@cpindex Strings, literals
When a process exec:s this segment is allocated.
It contains instructions, static constants, and
literals.
@item BSS segment
@cpindex Segment, @sc{BSS}
@cpindex @sc{BSS} segment
@cpindex @code{.bss}
@cpindex Block Started by Symbol
@cpindex Uninitialised variables
@cpindex Zero variables
@cpindex Global variables
@cpindex Static variables
When a process exec:s this segment is allocated.
It contains all global and static variables that are
initialised to zero or lacks explicit initialisation.
On some systems this segment is merged into the data
segment. @sc{BSS} is an acronym: `Block Started by Symbol'.
@item data segment
@cpindex Segment, data
@cpindex Data segment
@cpindex @code{.data}
@cpindex Heap
@cpindex Memory, heap
@cpindex Global variables
@cpindex Static variables
When a process exec:s this segment is allocated.
It is filled all global and static variables that
are not covered by the @sc{BSS} segment.
This segment's lower end is fixed, and its upper end
is unfixed; it can be resized. Any part of the segment
that is a result of it being resized, is referred to
as the heap.
@item stack segment
@cpindex Segment, stack
@cpindex Stack segment
@cpindex Memory, stack
@cpindex Call-stack
@cpindex Automatic variables
This segment contains a@footnote{Program stack's can
created programmtically, hence `a' rather than `the'.}
program stack. A program stack contains information
required to return after a function call, and automatic
variables. Depending on the platform and the function
it may also contain arguments passed in function calls
and return values. It grows as the stack grows, but
it does not shrink as the stack shrinks.
@end table

The layout of the segments is machine dependent and
operating system. However, a common@footnote{Keeping
in mind this cannot be assumed practice, and that
it is in fact different between systems.} layout is
have the text segment (as other fixed segments) start
at 0, and end at some positive address. The text
segment is then followed by the @sc{BSS} segment, and
the data segment. The stack segment however, grows
from the highest address (@math{-1} on two's
complement-machines) downwards. The process cannot
allocate any more memory when the allocation would
require the data segment to be grown to such an
extent that it would overlap with the stack segment.

In C there are multiple ways to allocate memory.
@itemize @bullet{}
@item
@cpindex Global variables
@cpindex Static allocations
Variables that are declared outside functions are
called global variables@footnote{Even if that are
declared with @code{static}. In this context,
@code{static} is only use to hide object from
other translation units.}. These are stored either
in the @sc{BSS} segment or in the data segment, depending
on their initialisation. Pointer are stored as
numerical values, and the content is stored in the
text segment. Arrays however are not stored, but
their content is. In the data segment (or in the
@sc{BSS} segment if the elements are zeroes.) These
allocations are known as @i{static allocations}.
@item
@cpindex @code{static}
@cpindex Static variables
@cpindex Static allocations
Variables that are declared inside functions, with
@code{static}, are stored just like global variables.
These are called static variables, and remain unchanged
between function calls, and only change in statements
other than the declaration statement. These allocations
are known as @i{static allocations}.
@item
@cpindex @code{auto}
@cpindex Local variables
@cpindex Automatic variables
@cpindex Automatic allocations
@cpindex Stack-allocations
Variables that are declared inside functions (these
are known as local variables), without @code{static},
but with @code{auto}, are called automatic variables.
These are stored in the stack segment, and are
deallocated when the function returns. Local variables
that are declared with neither @code{static},
@code{auto}, or @code{register} are often though of
as automatic; however, the compiler may choose to
add @code{register}. These allocations are known as
@i{automatic allocations}@footnote{Known in some other
programming languages as stack-allocations.}.
@item
@cpindex @code{register}
@cpindex Register variables
Variables that are declared with @code{register}
are not stored in any segment. They lack addresses
and stored as CPU registers.
@item
@cpindex Dynamic allocation
@cpindex Heap-allocation
Using system calls, a heap can be created, where
new allocations are stored. These are often allocated
with the function @code{malloc}, and are known as
@i{dynamic allocations}@footnote{Known in some other
programming languages as heap-allocations.}.
@end itemize

@cpindex Dynamic allocation
@cpindex Automatic allocations
@cpindex Stack-allocations
Some compilers, including @sc{GCC}, provide two
additional ways to allocate memory.
@table @asis
@item @i{Variable-length arrays}
@cpindex Variable-length arrays
@cpindex Arrays, variable-length
A simple example of variable-length arrays, available
with some compilers, is
@example
void function(size_t n)
@{
  int array[n];
  /* ... */
@}
@end example
Variable-length arrays have a special property:
they may be deallocated before the function returns.
In fact, they are returned once the variable becomes
invisible, this causes the follow example to work
without every exhausting the memory.
@example
void function(size_t n)
@{
  for (;;)
    @{
      int array[n];
      /* ... */
    @}
@}
@end example

@item @code{alloca}
@fnindex alloca
@code{alloca} is a special function that is implement
by the compiler. It increases the stack and returns
a pointer to the beginning of the new part of the stack.
It is similar to variable-length arrays, however the
allocation is not deallocated before the function returns.
This causes the follow example to eventually exhaust
the memory.
@example
void function(size_t n)
@{
  for (;;)
    @{
      int pointer* = alloca(n);
      /* ... */
    @}
@}
@end example
@end table

Both of these allocation-methods are both automatic
and dynamic.

@cpindex Memory exhaustion
Memory allocation functions return @code{NULL} if
the process cannot allocate more memory. However,
under typical configurations of the operating system
kernel, memory allocation functions can return
succesfully, even if the system's memory is exhausted.
The process's virtual address space is not exhausted,
so it thinks it can allocate the memory, but the machines
memory is exhausted, so once the process tries to write
to the memory, the kernel cannot map the virtual address
to a real address. When this happens the process is
killed by a @code{SIGSEGV}@footnote{Segmentation
violation, also known as segmentation fault.} signal.

@node The alloca function
@section The @code{alloca} function

@cpindex Dynamic allocation
@cpindex Automatic allocations
@cpindex Stack-allocations
@fnindex alloca
@hfindex alloca.h
The function @code{void* alloca(size_t n)} appears
on multiple systems: 32V, @sc{PWB}, @sc{PWB}.2,
3@sc{BSD}, 4@sc{BSD}, and @sc{GNU}. It has been
added to @command{slibc}, without require on
feature-test macros, despite not being standardised
(for instance, it does not appear in @sc{POSIX}).
This function is however not portable, and will not
be made available if @code{_PORTABLE_SOURCE} or
@code{_LIBRARY_HEADER} is defined. @code{alloca}
is defined in the header file @file{<alloca.h>}.

@code{void* alloca(size_t n)} is similar to the
function @code{malloc}. It allocates a contiguous
space of usable memory of @code{n} bytes, and
returns a pointer, which points to the beginning
of the allocated memory. However, the allocate
appears on the stack rather than the heap, and
it automatically deallocated when the function
whence the call to @code{alloca} was made. Be
cause if this, @code{alloca} is implemented as
a macro --- using an intrinsic function provided
by the compiler --- rather than as a function.

You must not try to free the memory explicitly,
with a function like @code{free}, or resize it
with a function like @code{realloc}. Just like
arrays and pointers to automatic variables,
memory management functions cannot operate
memory allocated with @code{alloca}.

@cpindex Memory exhaustion
Unlike @code{malloc}, @code{alloca} does not detect
memory exhaustion, thus it will never return
@code{NULL}. However, it is likely that the process
will receive @code{SIGSEGV}@footnote{Segmentation
violation, also known as segmentation fault.} if it
tries to access memory that could not be allocated,
or, depending on the kernel's configuration, before
it returns.

On typical kernels and kernel configurations,
@code{alloca} and @code{malloc} will handle memory
exhaustion identically.

Undefined behaviour may be invoked if @code{alloca}
is called within a function call. The behaviour
depends on the machine, the compiler, and
optimisations. You should avoid code similar to
@example
#define strdupa(string)  \
  strcpy(alloca((strlen(string) + 1) * sizeof(char)), string)
@end example

@code{alloca} has its restrictions --- limited lifetime,
cannot be explicitly deallocated, not growable, and
not shrinkable ---  but it can also be advantageous
because:
@itemize
@item
Results in cleaner code because it is deallocated
automatically.
@item
It does not waste any space on metainformation
required for bookkeeping.
@item
Uses a faster memory allocation mechanism.
@end itemize



@node Basic memory allocation
@section Basic memory allocation

@cpindex Dynamic allocation
@fnindex malloc
@hfindex malloc.h
@hfindex stdlib.h
@code{malloc} is the most general, and most commonly
used memory allocation facility. It is also the most
portable, and is available on all environments. There
are three important function that were introduced in
@sc{ANSI}@tie{}C. These are defined in @file{<malloc.h>},
however, they should be included via @file{<stdlib.h>}
whihc includes @file{<malloc.h>}.

@table @code
@item void* malloc(size_t size)
@fnindex malloc
@cpindex Memory allocation without initialisation
@cpindex Initialised memory allocation
Allocates a contiguous memory block of @code{size}
bytes of usuable memory, and returns a pointer
to the beginning of the usable part of the allocation.
The function allocates some extra memory for internal
bookkeeping, this part of the allocation is located
before the address the returned pointer points.
Allocated memory is uninitialised.

If the memory cannot be allocated (due to memory
exhaustion,) @code{NULL} is returned and @code{errno}
is set to @code{ENOMEM}.

It is implementation defined whether this function
returns @code{NULL} or a unique pointer, that can
be passed to @code{free}, if @code{size} is zero.
In @code{slibc}, @code{NULL} is returned.

The allocation be grown or shrinked at any time.
See @ref{Resizing memory allocations}.

In @sc{ISO}@tie{}C, @code{void*} can be implicitly
casted to any other pointer type. Therefore it
is sufficient (and preferable) to write
@example
int* ten_integers = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
@end example
You do not need to write
@example
int* ten_integers = (int*)malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
@end example

@tpindex max_align_t
@sc{ISO}@tie{}C11 defines the auxiliary data
type @code{max_align_t} which has a size
the guaranteed to be a power-of-two (possibly
1) multiple of the size of any intrinsic data
type defined by the C standard. Its size a
suitable aligment for any pointer type.
@code{malloc}, even before C11, uses its size
for the aligment of all pointers it returns.
@code{malloc(n)} is hence equivalent to
@code{memalign(sizeof(max_align_t), n)}. If
you want the pointer to be unaligned, call
@code{memalign(1, n)}.

@item void* calloc(size_t count, size_t size)
@fnindex calloc
@cpindex Memory allocation without uninitialisation
@cpindex Uninitialised memory allocation
This function is similar to @code{malloc}, but
it initialises the memory to zeroes. The only
other difference is that it as two parameters
rather than one.

If @code{count * size} would overflow, @code{NULL}
is returned and @code{errno} is set to @code{ENOMEM}.
Otherwise, @code{p = calloc(a, b)} is identical to
@example
p = malloc(a * b);
memset(p, 0, a * b);
@end example

@item void free(void* ptr)
@fnindex free
@cpindex Deallocate memory
@cpindex Memory, deallocation
Memory that is dynamically allocated (without
automatic deallocation) can be deallocated with
this function. It is required that @code{ptr}
is the pointer returned by the function that
allocated it. It must not have been incremented.
Undefined behaviour is invoked otherwise. One
exception is @code{NULL}, if @code{ptr} is
@code{NULL} nothing happens.

Do not try to free a pointer twice, undefined
behaviour. Neither should you try to pass
pointers to variables to this function, nor
pointers to functions, arrays, @code{main}'s
parameters, memory-mapped I/O, or memory allocate
with @code{alloca}. Function-like macros that allocate
memory with @code{alloca}@footnote{There functions
that will return pointers allocate with @code{alloca},
because the memory would be deallocated at the
return. Thus, such facilities are implemented as
function-like macros.} specifies so, and their
name typically end with an `a', which is not too
common for other functions.

Be also cautious of whether functions return
statically allocated arrays, which must not
be deallocated, or dynamically allocated
memory, which should be deallocated to avoid
memory leaks.
@end table

@file{<malloc.h>} also includes three unportable
functions.
@table @code
@item void* zalloc(size_t size)
@fnindex zalloc
This function is similar to @code{calloc}, but it
only has one parameter. Assuming @code{a} and
@code{b} are two @code{size_t}:s, and @code{a * b}
does not overflow, @code{calloc(a, b)} is identical
to @code{zalloc(a * b)}. @code{zalloc} is a
@command{klibc} extension.

@item void cfree(void* ptr, ...)
@fnindex cfree
This function is an obsolete function provided
by a number of C standard library implementations.
It has been replaced by @code{free}. @code{cfree}
is identical to @code{free}.

Different implementions @command{libc}, defined
@code{cfree} with different numbers of parameters,
therefore @code{slibc} declares @code{cfree} as
a variadic function, and ignores all but the first
argument.

@item size_t malloc_usable_size(void* ptr)
@fnindex malloc_usable_size
@cpindex Retrieve allocation size
@cpindex Allocation size, retrieve
This function returns the number of usable bytes
for a pointer. If @code{ptr} is @code{NULL}, zero
is returned. It has the same restrictions as the
function @code{free}.

@code{malloc_usable_size(malloc(n))} returns
@code{n} (and allocates memory in the process.)

This function is a @sc{GNU} extension and requires
@code{_GNU_SOURCE}.
@end table



@node Aligned memory allocation
@section Aligned memory allocation

@cpindex Memory alignment
@cpindex Pointer alignment
@cpindex Aligned pointers
@hfindex stdlib.h
@hfindex malloc.h
The library provides dynamic memory allocation
methods that returns pointers with specified
aligments. This can improve performance, but
can waste some memory.

@table @code
@item void* memalign(size_t boundary, size_t size)
@fnindex memalign
This function is similar to @code{malloc},
but it has an extra parameter as its first
parameter: the alignment of the return pointer.
If @code{boundary} is not a power of two,
@code{NULL} is returned and @code{errno} is
set to @code{EINVAL}.

This function is declared in the header file
@file{<malloc.h>}, you should however include
it via @file{<stdlib.h>} for portability.
It was deprecated by @sc{ISO}@tie{}C11, and
@code{aligned_alloc} was recommended.

It is unspecified how the function works. The
implemention in @code{slibc} will allocate a bit
of extra memory and shift the returned pointer
so that it is aligned.

As an extension, derived from @sc{GNU}, the
allocated memory can be deallocate (with
@code{free},) or reallocated. Note however, if
it is reallocated with @code{realloc}, it is
unspecified whether the pointer is guaranteed
to be aligned if a new pointer is returned.
In @code{slibc}, the alignment may be lost.
This behaviour has been chosen because aligned
memory allocation is uncommon in practice.

@item int posix_memalign(void** ptrptr, size_t boundary, size_t size)
@fnindex posix_memalign
This function is similar to @code{malloc},
but it has two extra parameters as its first
parameters:
@table @code
@item ptrptr
Output parameter for the pointer. Instead
of return a pointer, it is stored to
@code{*ptrptr} upon successful completion.
@item boundary
The alignment of the return pointer.
@end table

Additionally, the function returns zero
upon successful completion, or on error,
an @code{errno}-error code, rather than
setting the value of @code{errno}. Like
@code{malloc}, it can fail due to memory
exhaustion. In this can, @code{ENOMEM} is
returned. But it can also fails, and
returns @code{EINVAL}, if @code{boundary}
is not a multiple of @code{sizeof(void*)},
or if @code{boundary / sizeof(void*)} is
not a power of two.

This function is declared in the header file
@file{<malloc.h>}, you should however include
it via @file{<stdlib.h>} for portability.
It is only available if
@code{(_POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L) || (_XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600)}.

It is unspecified how the function works. The
implemention in @code{slibc} will allocate a bit
of extra memory and shift the returned pointer
so that it is aligned.

As an extension, derived from @sc{GNU}, the
allocated memory can be deallocate (with
@code{free},) or reallocated. Note however, if
it is reallocated with @code{realloc}, it is
unspecified whether the pointer is guaranteed
to be aligned if a new pointer is returned.
In @code{slibc}, the alignment may be lost.
This behaviour has been chosen because aligned
memory allocation is uncommon in practice.

@code{posix_memalign(&p, b, n)} is equivalent to
@code{(p = memalign(b, n))? 0: errno}, except
@code{posix_memalign} fails if its second argument
is not a multiple of @code{sizeof(void*)}, and
@code{errno} is unspecified.

@item void* valloc(size_t size)
@fnindex valloc
This function is similar to @code{memalign}.
@code{valloc(n)} is equivalent to
@code{memalign@-(sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE), n)};
the alignment is the memory page size.

This function is declared in the header file
@file{<malloc.h>}, you should however include
it via @file{<stdlib.h>} for portability.
It is only available if either of @code{_BSD_SOURCE},
@code{_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED}, or @code{__SLIBC_SOURCE}
is defined. It has been deprecated, and it is
recommended to use @code{memalign} or
@code{posix_memalign} instead.

It is unspecified how the function works. The
implemention in @code{slibc} will allocate a bit
of extra memory and shift the returned pointer
so that it is aligned.

As an extension, derived from @sc{GNU}, the
allocated memory can be deallocate (with
@code{free},) or reallocated. Note however, if
it is reallocated with @code{realloc}, it is
unspecified whether the pointer is guaranteed
to be aligned if a new pointer is returned.
In @code{slibc}, the alignment may be lost.
This behaviour has been chosen because aligned
memory allocation is uncommon in practice.

@item void* pvalloc(size_t size)
@fnindex pvalloc
This function is almost identical to
@code{valloc}, but @code{size} is rounded
up to the next multiple of the page size,
cause it allocate only whole pages, except
that the @code{slibc} implementation, among
other implementations, allocates extra memory
before the returned pointer for bookkeeping
and pointer shifting for alignment.

This function is declared in the header file
@file{<malloc.h>}, you should however include
it via @file{<stdlib.h>} for portability.
It has been deprecated, and it is recommended
to use @code{memalign} or @code{posix_memalign}
instead.

It is unspecified how the function works. The
implemention in @code{slibc} will allocate a bit
of extra memory and shift the returned pointer
so that it is aligned.

This behaviour has been chosen because aligned
memory allocation is uncommon in practice.

@item void* aligned_alloc(size_t boundary, size_t size)
@fnindex aligned_alloc
This function is identical to @code{memalign},
except it the memory can be deallocated in
all C standard library implementations.

This function is declared in the header file
@file{<malloc.h>}, you should however include

@node Resizing memory allocations
@section Resizing memory allocations

@cpindex Reallocating memory
@cpindex Memory, reallocation
@cpindex Resizing memory allocations
@cpindex Memory, resize allocations
Since @sc{ANSI}@tie{}C, it has been possible
to resize memory allocations. In true C fashion
this should be avoided, and linked lists should
be used instead. However, this is useful because
it simplifies to the program code.

@table @code
@item void* realloc(void* ptr, size_t size)
@hfindex stdilb.h
@hfindex malloc.h
@sc{ANSI}@tie{}C defines this function to be
defined in the header file @file{<stdlib.h>},
although some implementations, including
@code{slibc} defines it in the non-standard
header file @file{<malloc.h>} which is included
by @file{<stdlib.h>}.

This function resizes a memory allocation,
and if necessary creates a new allocation.

@code{realloc}'s behaviour depends on the
arguments pass:
@table @asis
@item @code{ptr == NULL}
The behaviour is identical to that of @code{malloc}.
@item @code{ptr != NULL && size == 0}
The behaviour is identical to that of @code{free},
and @code{NULL} is returned, 
@item Otherwise
The allocation created by the function call that
return @code{ptr} will be resized so that its
usable area is @code{size} bytes. It up to the
implemention to select whether the reallocation
is necessary. @command{slibc} will always resize
unless the @code{size} equals the old size.
However, if a reallocation is impossible,
the function will use @code{malloc} to create
a new allocation, copy the data from the old
to the new allocation, and then deallocate
the old allocation.

The function will return @code{ptr} if a
reallocation was possible, a unique pointer
a new allocation was required, or @code{NULL}
on error. On @code{NULL}, @code{errno} will
be set to @code{ENOMEM} (there was a memory
exhaustion,) and @code{ptr} is untouched.

An appropriate way to use @code{realloc} is
@example
void* p;
size_t psize, new_size;
/* ... */
@{
  void* old = p;
  p = realloc(p, new_size);
  if (p == NULL)
    @{
      p = old;
      goto fail; /* @w{@xtext{Where @xcode{p} is cleaned up.}} */
    @}
  psize = new_size;
@}
@end example
@end table

Note that if @code{ptr == NULL && size == 0},
the behaviour is identical to that of @code{malloc},
not @code{free}. It is implemention defined,
whether @code{NULL} or a unique pointer, that
can be passed to @code{free}, is returned. In
the @command{slibc} implementation, @code{NULL}
is returned, and thus, the behaviour is also
identical to that of @code{free}.
