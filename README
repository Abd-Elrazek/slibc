slibc, the Stockholm C Library, is an implementation
of a C libray, for POSIX, just for fun.

slibc does not aim to support C++, or any other
language than C. Furthermore, it does not try
to support older versions of C than C99.


Macro definitions:

	_SLIBC_SOURCE             -- Enable slibc extensions. These extensions
	                               are usually extensions introduced in other
	                               C libraries, but are considered good extensions.
	_GNU_SOURCE               -- Enable glibc extensions (GNU extensions.)
	_BSD_SOURCE               -- Enable BSD extensions.
	_SLIBC_SUPPRESS_WARNINGS  -- Suppress all #warning, this is primarily
	                               intended to be used when compiling slibc.
	_PORTABLE_SOURCE          -- Unconditionally disable all extensions.


slibc provides some slib-specific extensions that
do not require _SLIBC_SOURCE. (They are however
disabled if _PORTABLE_SOURCE is defined.) These
extensions are defined in header files whose
name starts with `slibc-`. Headers starting with
`slibc/` are not extensions, those are internals
that may change at any time.
