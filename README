slibc, the Stockholm C Library, is an implementation
of a C libray, for POSIX, just for fun.

slibc does not aim to support C++, or any other
language than C. Furthermore, it does not try
to support older versions of C than C99.


Macro definitions:

	_SLIBC_SOURCE             -- Enable slibc extensions.
	_GNU_SOURCE               -- Enable glibc extensions (GNU extensions.)
	_SLIBC_SUPPRESS_WARNINGS  -- Suppress all #warning, this is primarily
	                               intended to be used when compiling slibc.
	_PORTABLE_SOURCE          -- Unconditionally disable all extensions.
