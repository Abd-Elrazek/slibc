/**
 * Set the high end of the calling process's
 * data segment.
 * 
 * The high end is defined as the last byte
 * in the segment plus 1.
 * 
 * Using `brk` is highly discouraged. `malloc`,
 * `calloc` and `free`, and its related functions,
 * fall be used instead as they are much more
 * conformable. Use of `brk` can couse errors
 * when using `malloc`, `free`, &c. Thus, `brk`
 * shall (bascially) only be used if you are
 * writting an alterantive malloc-implementation.
 * 
 * `brk` was marked LEGACY in SUSv2, and it
 * was removed from the POSIX standard in revision
 * POSIX.1-2001. It is however fundamental in
 * implementing a fast `malloc`-implementation.
 * 
 * @param   address  The process's new high end of its data segment.
 *                   If lower than the current low end, nothing will
 *                   happen and the function will return with a success
 *                   status.
 * @return           Zero on succes, -1 on error. On error, `errno`
 *                   is set to indicate the error.
 * 
 * @throws  ENOMEM  The process can allocate the requested amount
 *                  of memory. Either the process store limit would
 *                  have been exceeded, RAM and swap memory would
 *                  have been exhausted, or the request would cause
 *                  the data segment to overlap another segment.

/**
 * Set and get the current high end of the calling
 * process's data segment.
 * 
 * There is some documents that state that the new,
 * rather than the previous, high end is returned.
 * Additionally, some documentions do not document
 * possible failure. Thus only `sbrk(0)` is guaranteed
 * to be portable. The return type differs between
 * implementations; common return types are `int`,
 * `ssize_t`, `ptrdiff_t`, `ptrdiff_t`, `intptr_t`,
 * and `void*`. Note that `int` is
 * microarchitecture-portable.

 *                 zero means that the high end shall not be moved
 *                 (thus the current high end is returned,) a
 *                 positive value will cause the segment to grow,
 *                 a negative value will cause the segment to shrink.
 * @return         The previous high end. `(void*)-1` is returned on error.
