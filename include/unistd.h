/**
 * Daemonise the process. This means to:
 * 
 * -  close all file descritors except for those to
 *    stdin, stdout, and stderr,
 * 
 * -  remove all custom signal handlers, and apply
 *    the default handlers.
 * 
 * -  unblock all signals,
 * 
 * -  remove all malformatted entries in the
 *    environment (this not containing an '=',)
 * 
 * -  set the umask to zero, to be ensure that all
 *    file permissions are set as specified,
 * 
 * -  change directory to '/', to ensure that the
 *    process does not block any mountpoint from being
 *    unmounted,
 * 
 * -  fork to become a background process,
 * 
 * -  temporarily become a session leader to ensure
 *    that the process does not have a controlling
 *    terminal.
 * 
 * -  fork again to become a child of the daemon
 *    supervisor, (subreaper could however be in the
 *    say, so one should not merely rely on this when
 *    writing a daemon supervisor,) (the first child
 *    shall exit after this,)
 * 
 * -  create, exclusively, a PID file to stop the daemon
 *    to be being run twice concurrently, and to let
 *    the daemon supervicer know the process ID of the
 *    daemon,
 * 
 * -  redirect stdin and stdout to /dev/null,
 *    as well as stderr if it is currently directed
 *    to a terminal, and
 * 
 * -  exit in the original process to let the daemon
 *    supervisor know that the daemon has been
 *    initialised.
 * 
 * Before calling this function, you should remove any
 * environment variable that could negatively impact
 * the runtime of the process.
 * 
 * After calling this function, you should remove
 * unnecessary privileges.
 * 
 * Do not try do continue the process in failure unless
 * you make sure to only do this in the original process.
 * But not that things will not necessarily be as when
 * you make the function call. The process can have become
 * partially deamonised.
 * 
 * @param   name   The name of the daemon. Use a hardcoded value,
 *                 not the process name. Must not be `NULL`.
 * @param   flags  Flags to modify the behaviour of the function.
