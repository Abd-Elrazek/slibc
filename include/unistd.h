 * Using `brk` is highly discouraged. `malloc`,
 * `calloc` and `free`, and its related functions,
 * fall be used instead as they are much more
 * conformable. Use of `brk` can couse errors
 * when using `malloc`, `free`, &c. Thus, `brk`
 * shall (bascially) only be used if you are
 * writting an alterantive malloc-implementation.
 * 
 * `brk` was marked LEGACY in SUSv2, and it
 * was removed from the POSIX standard in revision
 * POSIX.1-2001. It is however fundamental in
 * implementing a fast `malloc`-implementation.
 * 
 * @param   address  The process's new high end of its data segment.
 *                   If lower than the current low end, nothing will
 *                   happen and the function will return with a success
 *                   status.
 * @return           Zero on succes, -1 on error. On error, `errno`
 *                   is set to indicate the error.

 * @throws  ENOMEM  The process can allocate the requested amount
 *                  of memory. Either the process store limit would

 * There is some documents that state that the new,
 * rather than the previous, high end is returned.
 * Additionally, some documentions do not document
 * possible failure. Thus only `sbrk(0)` is guaranteed
 * to be portable. The return type differs between
